Description: repository management tool built on top of git
 Repo is a repository management tool that we built on top of Git. Repo
 unifies the many Git repositories when necessary, does the uploads to our
 revision control system, and automates parts of the Android development
 workflow. Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make it easier to work
 with Git in the context of Android. The repo command is an executable Python
 script that you can put anywhere in your path. In working with the Android
 source files, you will use Repo for across-network operations. For example,
 with a single Repo command you can download files from multiple repositories
 into your local working directory.
 .
 repo is an unusual tool because it downloads all of the python modules it
 needs to run using GPG-signed git tags, and stores those files as part of the
 project that it is working with.  So this package just provides the wrapper
 script, which provides the GPG signing keys for verifying that the correct
 python code was downloaded.
